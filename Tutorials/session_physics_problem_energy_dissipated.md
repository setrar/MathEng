## Physics Problem: Total Energy Dissipated in a Resistor

### Problem:
A voltage signal $v(t)$ is connected across a 5 Î© resistor at $t = 0$. If the voltage is defined by:

$$
v(t) = 2\exp(-3t) + 4\exp(-7t)
$$

What is the total energy dissipated in the resistor?

### Solution:
To find the total energy dissipated in the resistor, we first calculate the instantaneous power dissipated at any time $t$, and then integrate this power over time to find the total energy.

The power dissipated in a resistor is given by:

$
P(t) = rac{v^2(t)}{R}
$

where $v(t)$ is the voltage across the resistor, and $R$ is the resistance. In this case, the resistance $R = 5 \, \Omega$, and the voltage across the resistor is:

$
v(t) = 2e^{-3t} + 4e^{-7t}
$

First, compute $v^2(t)$:

$
v^2(t) = \left( 2e^{-3t} + 4e^{-7t} 
ight)^2
$

Expanding this:

$
v^2(t) = 4e^{-6t} + 16e^{-14t} + 16e^{-10t}
$

Now, the power $P(t)$ dissipated at any time $t$ is:

$
P(t) = rac{v^2(t)}{5} = rac{4e^{-6t} + 16e^{-14t} + 16e^{-10t}}{5}
$

Now, to find the total energy dissipated, we integrate the power over time from $t = 0$ to $t = \infty$:

$
E = \int_0^\infty P(t) \, dt
$

Substitute the expression for $P(t)$:

$
E = \int_0^\infty \left( rac{4e^{-6t}}{5} + rac{16e^{-14t}}{5} + rac{16e^{-10t}}{5} 
ight) dt
$

We can separate this into three integrals:

$
E = rac{4}{5} \int_0^\infty e^{-6t} \, dt + rac{16}{5} \int_0^\infty e^{-14t} \, dt + rac{16}{5} \int_0^\infty e^{-10t} \, dt
$

The integral of $e^{-at}$ is $rac{1}{a}$, so we compute each term:

$
\int_0^\infty e^{-6t} \, dt = rac{1}{6}, \quad \int_0^\infty e^{-14t} \, dt = rac{1}{14}, \quad \int_0^\infty e^{-10t} \, dt = rac{1}{10}
$

Now substitute these values back into the expression for $E$:

$
E = rac{4}{5} \cdot rac{1}{6} + rac{16}{5} \cdot rac{1}{14} + rac{16}{5} \cdot rac{1}{10}
$

Simplifying each term:

$
E = rac{4}{30} + rac{16}{70} + rac{16}{50}
$

Finding a common denominator:

$
E = rac{28}{210} + rac{48}{210} + rac{67.2}{210}
$

$
E = rac{143.2}{210}
$

$
E pprox 0.682 \, 	ext{Joules}
$

Thus, the total energy dissipated in the resistor is approximately $0.682 \, 	ext{J}.

    "The \"flipped classroom\" is an instructional approach where the traditional model of teaching is reversed. Instead of listening to lectures in class and doing homework afterward, students first engage with new material at home (often through videos, readings, or online modules). Then, class time is used for interactive activities like discussions, problem-solving, or applying concepts with the help of the teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "1. **Pre-Class Preparation**: Students watch lectures or review materials at home.\n",
    "2. **Active Learning in Class**: Class time is used for engaging in activities, group work, and real-time feedback.\n",
    "3. **Teacher's Role**: Instructors guide and support students during in-class activities, focusing on application rather than lecturing.\n",
    "4. **Student-Centered**: It encourages self-paced learning outside the classroom and active participation during class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method promotes deeper understanding and allows more personalized learning support during class."

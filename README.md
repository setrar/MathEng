# Essential Mathematical Methods for Engineers

Prof: EVANS Nicholas

## Abstract

This course aims to present a treatment of mathematical methods suitable for engineering students who are interested in the rapidly advancing areas of signal analysis, processing, filtering and estimation. Significant current applications related to, e.g., speech and audio, music, wired and wireless communications, instrumentation, multimedia, radar, sonar, control, biomedicine, transport and navigation. The course presents a study of linear algebra, probability, random variables, and analogue systems as a prerequisite to material relating to sampled-data systems.  Time permitting, the final part of the course covers the concepts of random processes, the analysis of random signals, correlation and spectral density.

`Teaching and Learning Methods:` The course is comprised of lectures, exercises and lab. sessions.

`Course Policies:` Attendance at practical sessions are mandatory.

This course is aimed at students who have NOT already completed preparatory classes.  Completion of all in-lecture examples is strongly advised.
